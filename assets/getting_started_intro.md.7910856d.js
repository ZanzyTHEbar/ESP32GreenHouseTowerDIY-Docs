Featuring a vertical tower system with interlocking parts and an adapter to a common <code>20L/5gallon</code> bucket.</p><p>The design also features an optional 3D printable Aeroponics Nozzle for converting the system from the standard hydroponic to aeroponics.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p><blockquote><p>This is a work in progress and under active development.

You will also need to purchase the PCB&#39;s <code>~$40</code>, power supply and sensors <code>~$30</code>. The cost of the parts will vary depending on the size of the tower, and the number of sensors. The cost of 3D printing the tower will be <code>~$25</code> or less. The full <code>1m</code> tower consumes <code>~2kg</code> of <code>PETG</code> - which is the recommended printing material for outdoor use. The tower can be printed in <code>ABS</code> and/or <code>PETG</code> materials.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p><p>The cost of plant nutrients is <strong>not</strong> taken into account, and is up to you to control.</p></div><p><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of this project was to build a high-efficiency, very low cost direct DIY vertical tower garden for growing small fruits and vegetables.</p><hr><h2 id="how-to-setup" tabindex="-1">How to Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Setup is very straight forward, thankfully.
