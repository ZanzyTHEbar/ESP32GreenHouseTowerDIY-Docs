# Things To Know Before You Start {.text-[var(--font-accent)]}

## This page will be an overview of things to know and understand before you start this project

### Firmware is not final

Bugs can and will occur which may hinder the experience or useability at times.
Do not expect 100% reliable and perfect function. Not all features are fully developed yet.

### Firmware may have user difficulties

Our firmware has not been tested widely so issues may creep up.

### Documentation may be incomplete

Important steps may be missing.

### Some DIY knowledge is required

You will need to know how to DIY and think critically to complete this project.

A good general place to start looking for information is on the [Wikipedia aeroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroponics) page, they have a lot of good information and sources for validation and future reading.

### Youtubers

A great place to get started is to watch some videos on aeroponics. Here are some good ones to get you started:
