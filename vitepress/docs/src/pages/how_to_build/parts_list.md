           It is good practice to buy more than needed in some cases, namely programmers and ESPs, this reduces the risk of a DOA (dead on arrival) causing a delay.

## IR Emitters

- 4x Unfocused SMD IR emitters
Recomended ones [from LCSC here](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Infrared-IR-LEDs_XINGLIGHT-XL-3216HIRC-850_C965891.html).
Alternative ones [from Digikey here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/inolux/IN-P32ZTIR/10384796). The difference between them is the ones from LCSC are rated for lower power, which means in the event of a short or mishap they should be safer, hence why they are recommended.

        <p>
           The smaller ones can not be soldered at temps above 245C or they will burn. Low temp solder is recommended.

### Other Headsets

If you own another headset not listed above, that means there are no mounts designed for them yet. If you have basic skills in modeling or think up a solution to mount cams and emitters, please try to make a mount and then let us in the discord know so it can be added here. Any headset that can fit the camera is potentially compatible. If you are willing, give it a shot to design a mount for the rest of the community.

Check out our basic guide on making your own mount [here.](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/creating_your_own_camera_mount/)
