            question: "What is the goal of this project?",

            question: "What headsets will be supported?",

            question: "How will this work?",
            answer: "Currently, a camera is mounted inside the headset for each eye. The camera streams through wifi to a PC client which processes and sends eye tracking data to an OSC endpoint ex VRChat.",

            question: "What features will be supported?",
            answer: "The goal is eye tracking with eye openness, and some form of pupil dilation. A far away aspiration of this project is some form of weak foveated rendering because it's cool and any small performance increase in VR is welcome.",

            question: "Will IR damage my eyes?",
            answer: "This project has safety in mind. If you do all of the safety measures that we put into place and visually test the amount of IR light you will be fine. Please note we have not finished development of all safety stuff so be careful.",

This stands true still as of 5/3.",
